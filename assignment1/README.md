Q1: k-Nearest Neighbor classifier (*knn.ipynb*)

Q2: Training a Support Vector Machine (*svm.ipynb*)

Q3: Implement a Softmax classifier (*softmax.ipynb*)

Q4: Two-Layer Neural Network (*two_layer_net.ipynb*)

Q5: Higher Level Representations: Image Features (*features.ipynb*) will walk you through this exercise, in which you will examine the improvements gained by using higher-level representations as opposed to using raw pixel values.

Q6: Cool Bonus: Do something extra!

# CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition       
     
## Spring 2017

The repo contains my assignments for CS231n. The course materials can be found at [here](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/). There are 3 assignments in total.
   
1. [Assignment1](http://cs231n.github.io/assignments2017/assignment1/)




2. [Assignment2](http://cs231n.github.io/assignments2017/assignment2/)
The goal of assignment2 is to understand Neural Network and backprogagation
- understand Neural Networks and how they are arranged in layered architectures
- understand and be able to implement (vectorized) backpropagation
- implement various update rules used to optimize Neural Networks
- implement batch normalization for training deep networks
- implement dropout to regularize networks
- effectively cross-validate and find the best hyperparameters for Neural Network architecture
- understand the architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks and train gain experience with training these models on data

- Q1: Fully-connected Neural Network
- Q2: Batch Normalization
- Q3: Dropout 
- Q4: Convolutional Networks
- Q5: PyTorch / TensorFlow on CIFAR-10

# CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition       
     
## Spring 2017

The repo contains my assignments for CS231n. The course materials can be found at [here](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/). There are 3 assignments in total.
   
1. [Assignment1](http://cs231n.github.io/assignments2017/assignment1/)
The goal of assignment1 is to understand the basic Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages), the train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning. The implementation and application of a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier, a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, a Softmax classifier, and a Two layer neural network classifier are also required.

- Q1: [k-Nearest Neighbor classifier](https://github.com/SarahQiong/CS231n_2017/blob/master/assignment1/knn.ipynb)
- Q2: [Training a Support Vector Machine](https://github.com/SarahQiong/CS231n_2017/blob/master/assignment1/svm.ipynb) 
- Q3: [Implement a Softmax classifier](https://github.com/SarahQiong/CS231n_2017/blob/master/assignment1/softmax.ipynb)
- Q4: [Two-Layer Neural Network](https://github.com/SarahQiong/CS231n_2017/blob/master/assignment1/two_layer_net.ipynb)
- Q5: [Higher Level Representations: Image Features](https://github.com/SarahQiong/CS231n_2017/blob/master/assignment1/features.ipynb)


2. [Assignment2](http://cs231n.github.io/assignments2017/assignment2/)
The goal of assignment2 is to understand Neural Network and be able to implement backprogagation, implement various optimization rules, implement batch normalization and dropout for training networks.

- Q1: [Fully-connected Neural Network](https://github.com/SarahQiong/CS231n_2017/blob/master/assignment2/FullyConnectedNets.ipynb)
- Q2: [Batch Normalization](https://github.com/SarahQiong/CS231n_2017/blob/master/assignment2/BatchNormalization.ipynb)
- Q3: [Dropout](https://github.com/SarahQiong/CS231n_2017/blob/master/assignment2/Dropout.ipynb)
- Q4: [Convolutional Networks](https://github.com/SarahQiong/CS231n_2017/blob/master/assignment2/ConvolutionalNetworks.ipynb)
- Q5: [TensorFlow on CIFAR-10](https://github.com/SarahQiong/CS231n_2017/blob/master/assignment2/TensorFlow.ipynb)
